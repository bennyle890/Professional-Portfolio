# Benny Le's Portfolio

## Portfolio Repository

This repository showcases a little description about myself as a person and why I chose coding as a future career. Utilizing [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), I created this website through HTML and CSS. 

Currently, I do not have any professional work that is solely created by me or as a group. In place of this, I placed pictures from google and mentioned that it is 'Under Construction'. They are linked to YouTube videos of miscellaneous videos depending on the theme attached.
