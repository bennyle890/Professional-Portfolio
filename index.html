            <h2>Hi! You can call me Benny. I am a coding student at UNCC and an aspiring Software Engineer based in North Carolina </h2>
            <p>
                I currently work as a night shift Emergency Department Technician at a Level 1 Trauma center. I graduated in 2020 with a Bachelor's of Science in Exercise Science with a minor in Biology. As I continued my journey through healthcare, I discovered that I wanted to express my creative and logical side outside of patient care. Utilizing my creativity, I am able to design to my heart's desire and my logical to code. As I am inexperienced, I believe that my lack of experience allows me to learn and be open to the opportunities that arise. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoy traveling and admiring the beautiful architecture that different venues of the world have to offer.
